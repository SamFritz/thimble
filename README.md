# Thimble and Clover

**Task Set 1**

Navigate to your GitHub repository and add an image of any kind using the “Add file” button
Edit your README file and add at least two sizes of heading (Use #’s), some bold text (Use "**"**), some italic text (Use "*" "*"), a link to a web location of your choice (Use ), and add your image to your page (Use  and remember that if the file is in a folder you need to use its full path)
Try out some of the other elements shown in the Markdown Cheat sheet (I am personally a fan of using “Horizontal Rule” to break up pages and “Footnotes” for in text citations or references)
Once you have finished editing your README file and are happy with the preview, commit your changes with an appropriate commit message
