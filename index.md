IMAGE NOTES

# Publishing Notes

Go to - settings > pages

Option 1: 
- choose a theme --> this will create a new branch (github pages) and will be where webpage is hosted
- new files are created ( index.md --> front page of your webpage; by default it will fill in content from theme picker)
- content is not carried from main branch; usually set up gh-pages first
- action button = see website being built

Option 2:
- pick a branch to be source for content for web pages - choose if repository is purposed for creating webpage with no other functionality

[^1]: Images have an exclaimation point infront; relative link = looks in the repository; if inside a folder; need to introduce the path (e.g. /image); and square brackets provide the alt text; useful for accessibility for instance screen readers*
